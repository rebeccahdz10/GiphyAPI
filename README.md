# GiphyAPI

I need to add all basic elements to my html. I would to start with an array of my topics, and create a loop that goes through the array which will also create a button for each item in my array.

I would then add a search feature where it would add that user input into a new button that is appended to the page and will search for that user input in Giphy.

The gifs would need to be paused when they first show up, and move when clicked on.

Maybe add some styling for the buttons and hover styling as well.
